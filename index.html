          <div class="text-container">
            <p>
              Alexene Farol Follmuth, also known under the pen name Olivie
              Blake, is a lover and writer of stories, many involving fantasy,
              the paranormal, or the supernatural.All genres I'm obsessed with,
              being the bookworm that I am.Furthermore, she explores in her
              books very interesting ideas like - what it means to be human (or
              not); the endlessly interesting complexities of life and love.
            </p>
            <p>
              She’s won the title of New York Times and Sunday Times bestselling
              author with The Atlas Six, which doesn't surprise me. Her writing
              transports you so deeply into the story that it’s truly impossible
              to put any of her books down!

              <h3>Masters of Death</h3>
              <p>
                This book is about a real estate agent—only the real estate
                agent is a vampire, and the house she has to sell is haunted,
                and the ghost haunting the house has been murdered, and he has
                no idea how he died. This book is also about a medium, and
                though this particular medium is definitely a shameless fraud,
                he isn’t entirely without his uses—seeing as he’s actually the
                godson of Death.
