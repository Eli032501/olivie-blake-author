          <div class="text-container">
            <p>
              Alexene Farol Follmuth, also known under the pen name Olivie
              Blake, is a lover and writer of stories, many involving fantasy,
              the paranormal, or the supernatural.All genres I'm obsessed with,
              being the bookworm that I am.Furthermore, she explores in her
              books very interesting ideas like - what it means to be human (or
              not); the endlessly interesting complexities of life and love.
            </p>
            <p>
              She’s won the title of New York Times and Sunday Times bestselling
              author with The Atlas Six, which doesn't surprise me. Her writing
              transports you so deeply into the story that it’s truly impossible
              to put any of her books down!

                <h3>Masters of Death</h3>
                <p>
                  This book is about a real estate agent—only the real estate
                  agent is a vampire, and the house she has to sell is haunted,
                  and the ghost haunting the house has been murdered, and he has
                  no idea how he died. This book is also about a medium, and
                  though this particular medium is definitely a shameless fraud,
                  he isn’t entirely without his uses—seeing as he’s actually the
                  godson of Death.

                <p>
                  CHICAGO, SOMETIME—Two people meet in the armory of the Art
                  Institute by chance. He is a doctoral student who manages his
                  destructive thoughts with compulsive calculations about time
                  travel; she is a bipolar counterfeit artist undergoing
                  court-ordered psychotherapy. By the end of the story, these
                  things will still be true. But this is not a story about
                  endings.
